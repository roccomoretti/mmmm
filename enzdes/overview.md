# Enzyme Design

Computational enzyme design is the process of using computers to (re)engineer enzymes for a particular biochemical process.

## What are enzymes?

Enzymes are biological catalysts. That is, they're "molecular machines" which accelerate the reaction rate of biochemical reactions.
Most biological processes involve an enzyme carrying out a chemical transformation.

While enzymes and enzyme-like molecules can be made of other biomolecules (e.g. ribozymes are made from RNA), most enzymes are proteins.

*Further Reading:* Most introductory biochemistry books have a good overview of enzymes. Also, [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme)

## How do enzymes work?

TODO: Add subpage with deeper theory.
