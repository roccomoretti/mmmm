# About this site

This is a site about techniques for the compuational modeling and design of biological macromolecules (primarily proteins, but also related molecules).

In particular, the aim is to focus primarily on _how_ one might go about doing such modeling on their own systems,
so there's more of a focus on methodology than on flashy results.

In some respects, the project is mostly an attempt by the author to help collate and organize information about recent
(and the still-relevant historical) techniques for protein modeling, as well as an excuse/incentive to stay current with the literature.

There's an unabashed bias toward Rosetta and Rosetta-related techniques, though other software

# About the author

Rocco Moretti is a research professor in the [Meiler Lab](https://meilerlab.org) and one of the developers of the [Rosetta software package](https://rosettacommons.org).
He has an interest in protein-small molecule interactions (including small molecule drug design and enzyme design), 
and is very interested in helping computational structural biology become easier to use for scientists.
