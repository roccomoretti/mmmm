# About this site

This is a site about techniques for the compuational modeling and design of biological macromolecules (primarily proteins, but also related molecules).

In particular, the aim is to focus primarily on _how_ one might go about doing such modeling on their own systems,
so there's more of a focus on methodology (& background) than on flashy results. 
The hope is that it can function as a starting point for new researchers (e.g. graduate level and above) working in the area.

In some respects, the project is mostly an attempt by the author to help collate and organize information about recent
(and the still-relevant historical) techniques for protein modeling, as well as an excuse/incentive to stay current with the literature.

There's an unabashed bias toward Rosetta and Rosetta-related techniques, though other software will certainly be convered.
It's also inevitably going to be biased toward things the author is interested in, rather than being an "unbiased" overview.

# About the author

Rocco Moretti is a research professor in the [Meiler Lab](https://meilerlab.org) and one of the developers of the [Rosetta software package](https://rosettacommons.org).
He has an interest in protein-small molecule interactions (including small molecule drug design and enzyme design), 
and is very interested in helping computational structural biology become easier to use for scientists.
